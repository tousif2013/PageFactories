how i have impliment
All the essential methodsare been declared as abstract method interface which is then implimented by the base class
we have all the initlization functions , generic actions  performing methods present in this class as click 
click with js and etc  .

all the evironment variables are been declared in constants class and we are consuming from there as constants.variablename

for every page  i am creating a class wherein  ihave created functions for elements  
this class has a contructor for its own as i have declare a private locatorclass variable (name depends on which   for which locators are stored)

this is been initalized by the object that is been created for the locatorclass and pagefactory,initelements intilizes these locators having parameter as driver and this.locators

in locator class i am storing the locators with findby annotation and below setting it to webelement; 

which is then accessed by class.locatorname

to handle dynamic elements a clss is created and if any page rquires action pbased on parameter the method created for that element should have called the forrmatter class where it it will hanlde %s
and give back the xpath then in the same method we can call the webelemnt and generic methods from page class
